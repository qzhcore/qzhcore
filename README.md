# 💫 About Me:
I’m a systems-focused developer specializing in high-performance Roblox game architecture and scalable backend design. I spend most of my time building the underlying technology that makes complex games stable, secure, and able to grow without collapsing under their own weight.<br>I’m also the founder of Darkk Games, an independent Roblox game studio focused on creating high-quality, system-driven experiences. Through the studio, I design both the games and the technical foundations behind them — building internal frameworks, backend services, and reusable architecture that allow projects to scale efficiently as they grow.<br>I care deeply about clean structure, long-term maintainability, and performance under load. I prefer designing modular service-based architectures over quick scripts, and I focus on keeping server logic authoritative and secure. My goal is always to build systems that other developers can safely extend without creating technical debt.<br><br>Most of my work revolves around:<br><br>- Designing server-authoritative gameplay systems<br>- Building modular frameworks and shared service layers<br>- Reducing network overhead and replication cost<br>- Preventing exploits through validation and secure state handling<br> Refactoring messy systems into scalable, maintainable architecture<br><br>At Darkk Games, these principles shape every project. We prioritize performance-first development, strong technical pipelines, and codebases that are built to last — not just to ship.<br><br>I enjoy solving problems that sit at the intersection of gameplay, networking, and performance — especially when a system needs to support large player counts, complex mechanics, or long-term content expansion.<br><br>I’m constantly improving how I:<br><br>- Structure large codebases<br>- Optimize runtime performance and memory usage<br>- Design systems that remain flexible as features evolve<br>- Balance development speed with technical quality<br><br>If you’re working on a serious project and need someone who thinks beyond “does it work” and instead focuses on “will this still work a year from now with 10x the players?” — we’ll probably get along.
